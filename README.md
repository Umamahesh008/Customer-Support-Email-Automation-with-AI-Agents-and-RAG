# Customer-Support-Email-Automation-with-AI-Agents-and-RAG
## Introduction
In today's fast-paced environment, customers demand quick, accurate, and personalized responses—expectations that can overwhelm traditional support teams. Managing large volumes of emails, categorizing them, crafting appropriate replies, and ensuring quality consumes significant time and resources, often leading to delays or errors, which can harm customer satisfaction.

Customer Support Email Automation is an AI solution designed to enhance customer communication for businesses. Leveraging a Langgraph-driven workflow, multiple AI agents collaborate to efficiently manage, categorize, and respond to customer emails. The system also implements RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) technology to deliver accurate responses to any business or product-related questions.
